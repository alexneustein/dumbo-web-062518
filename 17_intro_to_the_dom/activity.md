Students will go to their favorite websites and modify the DOM programmatically. Wikipedia and Twitter are good examples.
- Select elements and save them to variables
- Delete at least 2 elements
- Modify elements (e.g., replace image url, change text, change CSS)
- Create new elements and add to page
- Think programmatically about the DOM by solving problems with iteration and the use of multiple CSS selectors
  - Change all instances of one word
  - Replace all images on only a certain portion of the DOM
  - Change every other header
- Bonus (Hard): replace all elements of one tag to another (e.g., p to h1)
